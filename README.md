# Project 2
## by Trey Gower

## Overview
Solving the PDE Numerically with a 1-D FEM:
ut - uxx = f(x,t), where (x,t) ‚àà (0,1) x (0,1)

### Initial conditions:
u(x,0) = sin(ùúãùë•)
u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0
					
Test function and analytical solution:
f(x,t) = (ùúã2 - 1)e-tsin(ùúãùë•) & u(x,t) = e-tsin(ùúãùë•)


## How to use the code:
For each of these enter your desired values and it will compute the solution numerically to the heat equation
Enter N the total # of global nodes:

Enter xl the left boundary:

Enter xr the right boundary:

Enter (FE) for Foward or (BE) for Backward Euler Method:

Enter initial time:

Enter finial time:

Enter number of time steps:

# Problem 2 (Forward Euler):
N = 11, Xl = 0, Xr = 1, initial time = 0, final time = 1, time steps = 551

# Problem 3 (Backward Euler):
N = 11, Xl = 0, Xr = 1, initial time = 0, final time = 1, time steps = 551

# Conclusion:
Although I didn‚Äôt produce the correct answers fully I worked on this for a while and got far. Ultimately, I waited till the last minute to fully finish it and, unfortunately, it was not totally correct. The errors in my code arose from my K and M matrices and F vector being calculated somewhat incorrectly producing the wrong displacement vector. 

Here was what I got which produced the wrong results (My matrices and more importantly F vector was very sparse):
